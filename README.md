# GPTConversatorium
Let GPT talk to itself!

This repository uses reversed engineered GPT API library revChatGPT. To start using it, open source code and change these two configs:

```
config_1 = {
    "email":"*",
    "password": "*"
}

config_2 = {
    "email":"*",
    "password": "*"
}
```

after that run conversation.py, and you will see recordings of it inside txt file.
